# Random-Forest-Classification-Using-R- Wine Quality Clustering
## Introduction
Clustering is a type of unsupervised learning that allows us to groups of similar objects, these objeects can be related to each other than the objects in other simialr groups. This is often used when we don't we don;t have access to the ground truth, in other words, the labels are missing. In this project we will explore the simple and widely used clustering algorithm to reveal group of based on the chemical analysis reports

## Algorithm Used
Random forest is a machine learning algorithm that uses a collection of decision trees providing more flexibility, accuracy, and ease of access in the output. This algorithm dominates over decision trees algorithm as decision trees provide poor accuracy as compared to the random forest algorithm.

In simple words, the random forest approach increases the performance of decision trees. It is one of the best algorithm as it can use both classification and regression techniques. Being a supervised learning algorithm, random forest uses the bagging method in decision trees and as a result, increases the accuracy of the learning model.

## About the Project
This project is about wine quality classification Using R studio . I used historical data of wine chemical substances: 
fixed acidity,	volatile acidity,	citric acid,	residual sugar,	chlorides,	free sulfur dioxide,	total sulfur dioxide,	density,	pH,	sulphates,	alcohol, and	quality

# Objective
 - To separate the data into groups, or clusters with more similar traits to each other than to the data in the other clusters.
 - To reveal group of based on the chemical analysis reports
